Please ensure that you complete reading this README file, because it including so much
notes about this project. If you feeling confuse any time, please check this README
file carefully.

Before you can successfully make, please create two directory, obj and bin.

The project is the learning notes for the UNIX Network Programming(Volume1,3rd) book. The
project including all codes implement and solutions for exercise problems. The
organization of the project is following the book by chapter, so every chapter have a
directory under top directory but only if these chapter that there are example problem
existing. Maybe some other organization will appear in the future because of learning
arrangement.

The lib folder is from author's source codes. The other programs in each chapter directory
are from the author's book as sample programs, but I rewrite and test it for learning and
understanding aims. The exercise folder do by myself.

The two directories under chapter directory, one is examples_programs including all
example programs in this chapter, every program is named like "pxx.c", where "p" is the
shorthand of "page", and "xxx" is the number of page. This convention also apply to other
chapter directories, so the convention statement will not appear in other directories.

In each chapter directory, there are two directories existing in any chapter directory,
one is example_programs, it is for put the example programs for testing and rewriting. The
other directory is exercise, for containing exercise problems at the end of each chapter.

All executable are added to bin folder.
